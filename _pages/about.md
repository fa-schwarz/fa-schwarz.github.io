My name is Fabian (Frank) Schwarz and I am a cyber security expert and researcher with a focus on hardware-assisted system and network security architectures.
In particular, the focus during my PhD has been on the design and implementation of attack prevention, detection, and attribution solutions based on different forms of hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) and their remote attestation protocols.
In fact, I have practical experience in designing, implementing, and evaluating solutions based on Intel SGX, Arm TrustZone, and AMD SEV-SNP for per-application firewall policies, isolated network gateway routers, and secure FIDO2 web authentication based on electronic IDs.
Most recently, my focus has extended to virtual machine introspection for TEE VMs (also: TVMs, or confidential VMs), as well as the design of HW-SW interfaces for security extensions of RISC-V CPUs.


**I am at the job market now** and openly looking for cyber security research or architect positions in the area of system and network security, especially with focus on confidential computing or trusted computing technologies.
In addition, I'm currently finishing the publication process of one extra research project (in revision stage at a conference).


I have finished my PhD defense on 28th August 2024 at Saarland University and the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en) with my dissertation on "TEE-based Designs for Network Gateways, Web Authentication, and VM Introspection".
I obtained my Master of Science in Computer Science at Saarland University with my thesis on "Kernel-based Process Monitoring of Network Services" (using eBPF).
