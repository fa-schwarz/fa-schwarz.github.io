Bachelor thesis by Marcel Leuering at TU Dortmund University.
The goal of the project was a security analysis of the LoRaWAN protocol as implemented in '[The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/)' (TTN).
The student investigated the LoRaWAN protocol and TTN implementation to identify potential vulnerabilities, and implemented a virtual end device and gateway to test attack vectors in a private setup based on the '[The Things Stack](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/stack/)'.
The thesis concludes with an analysis of potential attacks and recommendations for the adoption of mitigation strategies.

I have co-supervised the project together with Dr. Johannes Krupp and Prof. Dr. Christian Rossow.
In particular, I provided the student with support and guidance during the second half of the project, as well as the write-up of the thesis.
I also served as an official reviewer of this bachelor thesis.
