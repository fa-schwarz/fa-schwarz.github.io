Cybersecurity Bachelor project by Tobias Kirsch and Jannik Pfeifer.
The goal was to design a dynamic analysis system to monitor the system calls and service calls (intents) of Android applications within an emulator.
The motivation was to augment our dynamic malware analysis sandbox ([Sandnet](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1978672.1978682)) with support for system behaviour traces of malicious Android apps.

I have co-supervised the project together with Prof. Dr. Christian Rossow.
My responsibilities were to support the students on technical design challenges, keep track of their progress during regular meetings, and provide them with feedback on their writeup/documentation.
